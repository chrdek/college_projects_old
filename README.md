     Update [05/06/2021 @02f5d77]: Gathered what I could find/build and included it in a DOSBOX runner (included in "Releases") so you can test some of the programs functionality.
     
     Extract default contents of DOSbox.zip to install dir of %ProgramFiles(x86)%\DosBox-0.74.
     Move folders with executables in C:\DOSBOX.
     Move new dosbox config settings to %LOCALAPPDATA%\DosBox to replace the current settings.

     Thats it.

     NOTE: Some programs work through dos, some are WIN10 compatible.
