*NOTE* The clrscr(); command used to restore the main menu screen after selecting an
option, may not work properly in some C/C++ compilers(e.g: DevC++). The clrscr();
command that we use works ok with Turbo C++ Compiler (DOS compiler). You can disable
this single command by defining it as a comment in the program source code.
